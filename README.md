# .NET-Extensions
.NET Extensions Methods Library for C# and VB.NET (ASP.NET, MVC, SL, WPF, EF)
The .NET Extensions project provides the missing piece that you always expected to be part of the Framework Class Library.

Copy from http://dnpextensions.codeplex.com/

Fork from JoySky GitGub (https://github.com/JoySky/.NET-Extensions)

The project literally contains hundreds of extension methods for well known FCL data types. You can just add a reference and start using them today.

Or follow me on Twitter (expect less updates here) @ http://twitter.com/PatrickLorenz   kick it on dotnet-kicks.de"

As full support for extension methods require .NET 3.5 this project does as well (actually SP 1).
Some sub projects (eg. ASP.NET MVC) require .NET 4.0.
The project compiles with Visual Studio 2010.
